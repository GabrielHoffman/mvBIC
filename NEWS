	o add generalized degrees of freedom for covariance estimate

# v1.1.1  April 16th, 2020
	o Improve documentation
	o add naive BIC method
	o add print and show methods


# v1.1   April 15th, 2020
	o define number of parameters for BIC as nparamsMethod = c("edf", "countLevels", "lme4")
	o set default to effective degrees of freedom: "edf" this reduce the penalty for random effects compared to counting the levels
	o set stopping criterion to delta of 10
