Description: mvBIC extends the standard the standard Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to the case of multivariate regression. The model fit across many response variables is evaluated and the criterion explicitly considers correlation between reponses. mvBIC is appiciable to linear and linear mixed models.  Forward stepwise regression with the mvBIC criterion enables automated variable selection for high dimensional datasets.
