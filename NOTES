TODO

if residual variances vary alow, var_equal can perform poorly

Add warning about small eigen-values or too many responses for shrink.method = "none"

Add faster method to approximate Touloumis_unequal
	Can I adjust scaling to better get constant variance?
	Currently Y is scaled, but residuals are not
	Set to that difference in log dets in the same
	

Add better error messages

DONE	
	Added generalized degrees of freedom basedon Ye 1998
	


If response variable is very low rank, then the model can keep fitting coefficients until it crashes


BIC and mvBIC for independent response variables are equivalent as n -> Inf

as N -> Inf, the correlation between independent response variables approaches 0, 
	so log det of emprical correlation matrix is same for diagnal of RSS values
	This only holds for finite p.  If p is also large, then correlation matrix is low rank

	Does this method work for large p?


The iterative method of Holbrook and maotai is equivalent to adding a constant to each eigen value


What does it say: iteration: 10
